An Ecommerce website where one can buy pets online and pet food. The user can create an Account, then select the Category he wants,e.g Guard Dog, then the user can search for the dog name(e.g PitBull), the user can then select this pet and proceed to cashout,he can also have an option to buy the Pet and pet food at the same time, that would give them a certain discount. Otherwise a user can also choose to buy Pet food Separately.
